# metaflow-exemplar

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed.

- AWS CLI setup.

- AWS credentials configured. 

### Steps

1. Update ``config/config.json`` with an s3 bucket of choice, a default is in place.

2. ``source setup.sh`` - the ``source`` command ensures the environment activates in your working shell. This command sets up a virtual environment, installs the required dependencies and moves the metaflow config into the right folder. 

3. ``python src/flows/training.py run`` from the root terminal.
